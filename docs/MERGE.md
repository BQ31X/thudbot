## 🎯 Option 1: GitHub PR Route (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push Latest Changes
```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
git status                    # Check for uncommitted changes
git add .                     # Stage any remaining changes
git commit -m "docs: Add checkpoint and merge documentation"
git push origin feat/thudbot-cc
```

### Step 2: Create Pull Request
1. **Go to GitHub repository** in your browser
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"** (GitHub usually shows this banner after push)
3. **OR manually create PR:**
   - Click "Pull requests" tab
   - Click "New pull request"  
   - Base: `main` ← Compare: `feat/thudbot-cc`

### Step 3: Fill PR Details
```markdown

```

### Step 4: Review & Merge
1. **Review the diff** - should show all your evening's work
2. **Check for conflicts** (shouldn't be any if main hasn't changed)
3. **Click "Merge pull request"** when ready
4. **Choose merge type:**
   - **"Create a merge commit"** (preserves branch history) 
   - **"Squash and merge"** (cleaner history, single commit)
   - **"Rebase and merge"** (linear history)

### Step 5: Cleanup
```bash
# After successful merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main          # Get the merged changes
git branch -d feat/thudbot-cc # Delete local feature branch
git push origin --delete feat/thudbot-cc  # Delete remote branch (optional)
```

## ⚡ Option 2: GitHub CLI Route

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# macOS: brew install gh
# Login: gh auth login
```

### Merge Commands
```bash
# Create PR via CLI
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: Complete Thudbot web application (notebook to production)" \
  --body "🚀 Major milestone: Converted Jupyter notebook to full-stack web app with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, and comprehensive testing. Ready for Aug 5 deadline! 🎯"

# List PRs to get PR number
gh pr list

# Merge the PR (replace #123 with actual PR number)
gh pr merge #123 --merge  # or --squash or --rebase

# Cleanup
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/thudbot-cc
```

## 🛠️ Option 3: Direct Git CLI Route (Use with caution)

**⚠️ Warning:** This bypasses PR review process. Only use if you're confident in changes.

```bash
# Switch to main and ensure it's up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feat/thudbot-cc

# Push merged changes
git push origin main

# Cleanup
git branch -d feat/thudbot-cc
git push origin --delete feat/thudbot-cc
```
