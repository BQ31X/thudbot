# ðŸ§  Profile Summary for AI Coding Partner / LLM Collaboration

## ðŸ§ª Python Skills
**Level**: Beginner-to-intermediate.  
**Strengths**: Strong conceptual understanding from decades in technical roles; comfortable navigating logic, flow control, and debugging ideas.  
**Current Capabilities**:
- Can read and adapt existing Python scripts.
- Familiar with key libraries: `LangChain`, `Streamlit`, `Qdrant`, `pytest`, `dotenv`, and some use of `uv`, `FastAPI`, and `RAGAS`.
- Uses `uv` for package management; prefers `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/` structure.
- Writes and runs code in Jupyter notebooks, terminal, and basic scripts (`app.py`).
- Can manage `.env` files, call APIs, and integrate tools in the LangChain agent ecosystem.

## ðŸ§± Software Engineering Practice
**Approach**: Professional, test-aware, repo-structured.  
**Current practices**:
- Uses Git with well-named branches and pre-commit checks (`check_and_commit.sh`).
- Builds modular, testable components (e.g., RAG retrievers, agent tools).
- Emphasizes clarity and extensibility over optimization or fancy tricks.
- Understands evaluation principles (metrics like context recall, noise sensitivity) and can instrument pipelines using tools like LangSmith.
- Frontend comfort: prefers Streamlit for speed, Flask for flexibility.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Style
**Strengths**:
- Learns fast through guided exploration and active debugging.
- Excellent at asking questions, interpreting system behavior, and narrowing down bugs.
- Applies product thinking and systems-level reasoning, even when hands-on coding skills lag.  
**Preferences**:
- Dislikes unexplained abstraction; prefers to know _how_ and _why_ things work.
- Gets frustrated by latency or slow iteration loops â€” values momentum.
- Builds mental models quickly but benefits from repetition to retain syntax details.
- Enjoys narrative metaphors and in-universe logic to make systems memorable.

## ðŸ’» Active Projects
**Thudbot**: RAG-based character agent for the game *The Space Bar*. Built with:
- GPT-4 Turbo + `text-embedding-3-small`
- LangChain agent tools
- Qdrant vector DB
- Local Streamlit app (in progress)

**Recent Stack Proficiency**:
- Python (LangChain, Streamlit, Qdrant)
- Agent orchestration with fallback logic
- RAG evaluation (RAGAS + LangSmith)
- CSV-based hint dataset with progressive disclosure (Ã  la Invisiclues)

**Stretch goals** include:
- Self-hosted SLMs (via Ollama)
- Stylized UI
- Memory/session tracking
