# Checkpoint Summary: Retriever Evaluation Complete

## Date: 2025-08-02

### Project Status

The Thudbot project has completed its first round of **retriever evaluation**, marking a major milestone in the RAG pipeline. The focus was on establishing baseline retrieval quality using RAGAS metrics and LangSmith traces, laying the groundwork for future tuning toward in-character hint delivery.

### Work Completed

- **LangSmith Tracing**
    
    - Successfully configured LangSmith traces for all retriever chains.
        
    - Group names and metadata (`retriever`, `dataset`) were added for meaningful analysis.
        
    - Verified trace behavior using `.invoke()` and `run_retriever_on_dataset()` with custom config names.
        
- **Retriever Setup**
    
    - Implemented three retriever chains:
        
        - `naive_retriever_chain` (OpenAI embeddings, Qdrant)
            
        - `bm25_retriever_chain` (BM25 on `hint_data`)
            
        - `multi_query_retriever_chain` (OpenAI multi-query retriever)
            
    - Ensured all retrievers used the same `platinum_data` source for fair comparison.
        
- **Evaluation Dataset**
    
    - Defined `platinum_dataset.json` with 12 rewritten, in-universe style queries and references.
        
    - Subsetted to 5 representative samples for efficient evaluation and cost control.
        
- **RAGAS Evaluation**
    
    - Ran **Context Recall**, **Entity Recall**, and **Noise Sensitivity** metrics on all three retrievers.
        
    - Results:
        
        |Retriever|Context Recall|Entity Recall|Noise Sensitivity|Avg Latency|Tokens (est)|Cost (est)|
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
        |**BM25**|0.3667|0.5690|0.0990|~1.5s|~1.8K|~$0.00021|
        |**Naive**|0.5067|0.6440|0.0833|~2.5s|~2.2K|~$0.00025|
        |**Multi-Q**|0.5067|0.7524|0.0125|~4.5s|~3.3K|~$0.00041|
        
    - **Observation:** Multi-query outperformed all others on retrieval quality, particularly on entity recall and robustness to noise, at a modest increase in latency and cost.
        
- **Token & Cost Management**
    
    - Reduced evaluation scope to 5 samples × 3 retrievers × 3 metrics to avoid runaway token usage.
        
    - Bypassed full re-generation of outputs for unmodified chains.
        
    - Verified `run_retriever_on_dataset()` costs are distinct from `ragas.evaluate()` costs.

### Next Steps

1. **App Implementation Begins**  
    Build the MVP interface that connects user input to the selected retriever chain and displays the resulting hint.
    
2. **Optional: Character-Driven Tuning**  
    Evaluate and refine the prompt for Thud’s voice and behavior. May involve:
    
    - LangChain custom evaluator
        
    - Vibe checks
        
    - Prompt experimentation
        
3. **Finalize Certification Challenge Deliverables**  
    Capture results and rationale in the final notebook. Polish traces, screenshots, and key metrics.
