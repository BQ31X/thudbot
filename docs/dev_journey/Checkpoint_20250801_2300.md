# Checkpoint Summary: Foundational Scaffolding Complete

## Date: 2025-08-01

### Project Status

The foundational architecture for the `thudbot` project has been successfully established. The project is now in a robust, professional, and version-controlled state, ready for feature development.

- **Project Origin:** Created by forking and modifying a new Python AI project template repository.
    

### Work Completed

- **File Structure:** Established a clean, professional file structure with `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/` directories.
    
- **Project Configuration:** Created `pyproject.toml` to manage project metadata and dependencies with `uv`.
    
- **Environment & Secrets:** Created a `.env.example` template to document required environment variables (e.g., API keys, debug flags) and configured `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive `.env` files.
    
- **Dependencies:** Identified and added key dependencies (`streamlit`, `langchain`, `qdrant-client`, `ragas`, `python-dotenv`) to `pyproject.toml` and a simple `requirements.txt`.
    
- **Testing & CI:** Created a simple, testable `app.py` function and a corresponding `pytest` file to ensure the `check_and_commit.sh` script is functional.
    
- **Workflow:** Defined a standard workflow (foundational work on `main`, development on feature branches) and created `00_notebook_setup.ipynb` to serve as a reusable setup script for notebooks.
    

### Next Steps

1. **Commit Foundational Work:** All foundational files will be committed to the `main` branch.
    
2. **Push to Remote:** The finalized `main` branch will be pushed to the GitHub repository.
    
3. **Branch for Development:** A new feature branch (e.g., `feat/initial-rag-pipeline`) will be created to begin the actual implementation of the Thudbot application's core functionality.
