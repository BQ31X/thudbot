        "\n",
        "Short answer is that semantic chunking in this case would group many of the short, similar sentences together. And, this would probably be desirable. But, if the bar is too low, it might group together sentences that are only superficially similar. To adjust this, you would raise the threshold, e.g. in this case, the percentile value that triggers a split.\n",

        "The Process\n",
        "First, split document into sentences (langchain uses sentence-based splitter, e.g. nltk.sent_tokenizer)\n",
        "Then do pairwise comparisons of the semantic distance between sentences.\n",
        "Then group sentences if they are \"close\" in semantic meaning, and split to a new chunk when the semantic distance to the previous sentence exceeds the threshold. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Math\n",
        "\n",
        "Percentile: \n",
        "Split when the semantic distance between two adjacent sentences is bigger than the n-th percentile of all adjacent-pair distances in the document. (Typical starting threshold: **75th or 80th percentile**. Lower the threshold to get smaller chunks (e.g. if topic shifts frequently) or raise the percentil to get fewer larger chunks)\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation: \n",
        "Split when the semantic distance between two adjacent sentences exceeds the mean by nore than n times the stddev of all adjacent-pair distances in the document. (Typical value: **n = 1.5**; threshold = **Mean + 1.5 × StdDev**)\n",
        "\n",
        "Interquartile:\n",
        "Split when the distance falls above the Q3 percentile by some factor, \"n\", of the \"interquartile range\" (IQR). IQR is the Q3 percentile - Q1 percentile. Example: threshold = Q3 + n x IQR (Typical value: **n = 1.5**; threshold = **Q3 + 1.5 × IQR**)\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient:\n",
        "This is kind of like a first order derivative, compared to the others. It essentially measures the velocity of change between the sentences (as opposed ot the distance), triggering a split when there is a sudden change. To do this, after calculating the distances between each set of pairs, you then calculate the gradients (the distances between the distances). The rule would be to split whenever the gradient exceeds a threshold, **N**.  \n",
