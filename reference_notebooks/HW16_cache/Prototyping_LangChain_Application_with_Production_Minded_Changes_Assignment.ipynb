        "\n",
        "Caching saves a great deal of time when you need to access the same data repeatedly. It is much faster than re-calculating (or re-embedding, or re-retrieving from a large database). However, it is only as useful as your cache hit ratio (i.e., what percent of the time are you able to provide the necessary answer from the cache). \n",
        "\n",
        "Using fast storage for cache provides the most speed benefit, memory is faster than disk, but faster storage is generally more expensive storage. You may need a caching strategy that cycles information in and out, based on recency and frequency of certain data being requested. If cache becomes stale (i.e. not accessed recently or frequently) it becomes a waste of the storage. Size is another related trade-off; how much storage do you need to cache the most frequently accessed information. At some point, adding more storage will provide diminishing returns, once you are caching less frequently accessed information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cache needs to be invalidated when it is no longer correct. Cache refresh intervals can vary widely (from minutes to months) depending on how static or dynamic the data is. Caching static data gives the best bang for the buck, as there is less overhead for cache management.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cache implementation above is limited to queries that exactly match the initial query. This may have limited practical use, as any variation in the question would be a cache-miss, and still need to hit the LLM. A smarter (semantic based) cache strategy would provide a higher likelihood of cache-hits, but also risk that if the question isn't similar enough, the cached answer may not be the best answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrent access of trying to read or write the same cache at the same time requires **appropriate locking mechanisms** to avoid inconsistencies. \n",
        "\n",
        "In a cold-strt scenario, cache needs to be warmed-up before any speed benefit is derivied. This can be done though lazy-loading, where the first instance for any query always pays full price (the time needed to hit the LLM), and subsequent instances of the same query get the cache benefit. If you have a good idea of what data to cache, a more active pre-loading approach can be used to warm the cache, so that even the first user query (of a cached item) still gets the benefit."

        "\n",
        "The helpfulness agent adds overhead. Best case, if the original answer is infact helpful - then the helpfulness check adds 1 message per query. In my testing I typically saw things like 5 messages for the helpfulness agent vss 4 messages for the simple agent, which is a 25% overhead. Visually scanning through the LangSmith traces for the helpfulness agent, I see that most of the helpfulness checks took between 0.4 and 0.6 seconds (with a couple of outliers taking much less time, when the overall response was very fast).\n",
        "\n",
        "For the most part, the average time across a sample of queries was ~.5 seconds longer for the helpfulness agent compared to the simple agent. In one experimenet (pictured above and [here](./AgentComparisonCapture2050815.png), we see that the average time was longer for the simple agent! This had me puzzled for a while...\n",
        "\n",
        ">##### AHA!\n",
        ">Sometimes it pays to sleep on a problem. It dawned on me, the next dawn, that I was running the tests back-to-back with the same queries. It is possible that the Helpfulness Agent, running second, was benefiting from the query cache which was offsetting (or more than offsetting) the additional half-second for the helpfulness check. I could run htee agents in the other order, but that still would not be a fair comparison. I could probably construct a fair-fight experiment (e.g. without cache) but I think it is sufficient to conclude that overall the added cost of each helpfulness check is about half a second (as supported by the LangSmith traces).\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever the original message was already good enough to 'pass' the helpfulness check, the check only adds one message to the transaction. \n",
        "In the case where the original message is not helpful, the additional check should add at least 3 messages to the total. (That still might be advantageous versus giving the user a bad response (and a bad User eXperience), plus the cost of an entire additional round-trip with the user.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In all my testing, I hit very few cases of a +3 (i.e. a case where the first attempt failed the helpfulness check). I don't know if this is a reflection of the high quality of the initial response, or low quality of the helpfulness check. I tried constructing a \"bad\" query to test this, but the initial answer was still a pretty good answer to the bad question, so I still can't conclude how helpful the helpfulness check really is.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Footnote]: ChatGPT said: \"It's very reasonable that you couldn't induce a helpfulness rejection — it’s a known challenge in testing these flows unless the base model is intentionally downgraded or the helpfulness check is made stricter.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 2. Production Considerations:\n",
        "Let's assume a ~.5second lateny cost for the helpfulness check (based on above). That's a half-second added to EVERY query/response. Is it worth it? That depends on the use case. What percent of time is the initial response good enough, and is that a good-enough rate of good-enough answers? For example, let's say the requirement is to be \"correct\" (or \"helpful\") 99% of the time, and you can't acheive that with the \"simple\" agent, then you many need to pay the extra cost for the iterative refinement. But if your threshold is lower, or the simple agent is good enough to meet the bar by itself, then the extra cost is not beneficial.\n",
        "\n",
        "The best use cases for a helpfulness check will be where there is a significant downside risk to giving a poor response.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangSmith (or equivalent) would be great for monitoring in production. With it you can see both: how often the helpfulness check is producing a refined answer and how much latency it is costing. And, lots of other detail. (I have not yet learned how to summarize LangSmith output; so I rely on spot checking the details, or averaging a set of runs)\n",
        "\n",
        "##### 3. Scalability questions\n",
        "I don't have enough understanding / information to answer this myself. Here is what I got based on discussing with ChatGPT:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rate limits: to protect from overage costs or overconsumption of resources - \"Many API's return headers indicating remaining quota, which can be monitored for dynamic throttling\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Circuit breakers: to protect from cascading failure - \"Circuit breakers typically track error rates or timeouts over a sliding window and open (block) if thresholds are exceeded. After a cooldown period, they test recovery with a trial request.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrent load: presumably, the lighter-weight simple agent would scale better. In either case, you would stil have to measure the impact of high load, and test for the concurrency limit. Also:\n",
        ">\"For both agents, you would need:\n",
        ">- **Concurrency-safe caching** to avoid redundant work -- also note my answer to Q1, above, about locking mechanisms for caching\n",
        ">- **Async or distributed execution** to handle parallelism\n",
        ">- **Rate limiting and circuit breakers** to protect external APIs and internal services\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Caching strategies: the caching we've studied so far include query caching and embedding caching.\n",
        "\n",
        "ChatGPT also suggested:\n",
        ">for simple agent:\n",
        ">LLM output caching (input → response)\n",
        ">Retriever cache: cache vector search results for popular queries\n",
        ">(and Embedding caching)\n",
        "\n",
        ">For helpfulness agent:\n",
        ">all of the above plus\n",
        ">Intermediate step caching (e.g., store the first draft response and its helpfulness score)\n",
        ">Semantic cache for evaluation results (e.g., if a query like “What’s the capital of Mars?” has already been flagged unhelpful once, reuse that judgment)\n"
