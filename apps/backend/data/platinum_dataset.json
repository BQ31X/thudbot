Similarly, the TSB-041 and TSB-042 hints describe that Fleebix, who is in a jar, relies on Thud to help with tasks like finding Thud or interacting with the environment to reach Quantelope Lodge. Both sets of hints emphasize the importance of troubleshooting and relying on in-game characters or tools\u2014such as fixing the terminal or seeking help from Thud\u2014to progress in the game, highlighting the interconnected nature of environment interaction and character assistance in achieving objectives.",
