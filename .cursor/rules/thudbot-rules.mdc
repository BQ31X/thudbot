- Prefers: uv package management, src/ structure, explicit explanations
- Stack: LangChain + LangGraph + OpenAI + FastAPI + Next.js + Qdrant
- Learning style: Guided exploration, asks good questions, values momentum
- Current project: Converting working AgentExecutor to LangGraph for Demo Day (8/25)
- Reference patterns from: reference_notebooks/06_MultiAgentLangGraph/
- Keep existing: multi_query_retrieval_chain, FastAPI structure, Next.js frontend
- Always use LangSmith tracing for observability
- Stop complex solutions early - user has good debugging intuition
- Always explain WHY before HOW when solving problems
- When stuck, step back and try simpler approach
- User prefers understanding root causes over quick patches
- Reference working examples from reference_notebooks/ when debugging
- Run `./check_and_commit.sh` before committing to ensure all checks pass
